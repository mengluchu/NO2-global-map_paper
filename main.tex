\abstract

High-resolution (100 m resolution or higher) mapping of NO2 provides opportunities to study the relationship between personal air pollution exposure and health over large populations. Statistical modelling of NO2 at the global scale provides high-resolution estimations for countries with deficient ground station measurements and provides air pollution maps and human exposures with consistent uncertainties for global health studies. Our objective is to develop temporally-resolved statistical learning models, understanding the temporal dynamics of NO2 and the contributing sources, and open-source our global NO2 prediction maps at 100 m resolution. The global maps are provided at various temporal aggregations (e.g. separating between weekdays and weekends, day and night) and spatial aggregations (e.g. multiple gridded resolutions, administrative units) to facilitate global exposure assessment. To create these maps, we compiled from multiple sources a dataset of hourly NO2 measurements from more than 7000 ground stations over the globe, which is a dataset that is considerably larger in size and spatio-temporal coverage than used in recent high-resolution NO2 mapping studies. For statistical modelling, geospatial predictors include Sentinel-5 satellite (Tropomi instrument) measurements, variables relating to the emission sources (e.g., road network), dispersion processes (e.g., meteorological variables), elevation and socioeconomic indicators (i.e. VIIRS nightlight data). We evaluate various statistical models including linear models, ensemble tree-based models, deep convolution models, stacked models with regularisation, and hierarchical modelling strategies and select the optimal one for mapping. Evaluation of models includes uncertainty assessment as well as spatial validation methods. 

\section{Introduction}
Opportunities in global mapping of NO2, limitation in current studies. 
weekday and weekend, day, night: statistical predictive, exposure assessment

As NO2 varies considerably over time (e.g., between seasons), an annual estimation of NO2 and other air pollutants, as has been done in most of the classical LUR (land use regression) modeling \citep{Eeftens2012}, is unable to provide sufficient information to assess exposure when the space-time activities are considered. A relatively small number of studies developed models considering temporal variability of air pollutant concentration. \cite{BONIARDI2019108520} and \cite{CORDIOLI20171075} studying seasonal LUR models of Black carbon, PM$_x$, and common gaseous pollutants found considerable differences between warm and cold seasons.  \cite{rahman2017development} fit a LUR model to the residuals of a  periodic model of the day of the year and the day of the week to predict daily average  NO$_x$ concentrations. \cite{dons2013modeling} created a LUR model representing the diurnal cycle (hourly resolution) for Black Carbon. They developed different LUR models for each hour of the day, which has important implications in exposure studies.

Also, separation in time also affect the prediction patterns and accuracy in spatial mapping \citep{LU2020105856}.

   

The objectives of this study are to: 
 \begin{enumerate}
\item develop a more in-depth understanding of the global modelling with external validation. 


\item provide an open-source, high resolution, temporally-resolved global NO2 dataset.

\item understand global NO2 patterns spatiotemporally. 
 
\end{enumerate}

3. Spatial pattern in different temporal aggregations.

We show two examples in northern hemisphere and with relatively dense ground monitoring networks (\cref{fig:hamla}) and two examples in southern hemisphere and with relatively sparse ground monitoring networks (\cref{fig:adbo}). It can be observed that besides Los Angeles, USA, all examples show lower NO2 values at night times compared to the day times during weekdays. The Weekend daytime values are in general lower than the weekday daytime values. The night time values can be higher than the daytime values in some areas in weekends.

\end{figure}

Observing \cref{fig:subdn}, we can summarise three patterns in terms of NO2 concentrations:

1) night$>$day for weekends but not weekday

This pattern may indicate lots of entertainment during night times in weekends and a relatively early rush hour after work.

Germany, Belgium, France, Spain, and the Netherlands show that in weekdays, NO2 concentrations are higher at daytime but in weekends at nighttime. The same pattern is shown along the western-southern coast of Australia, middle Brazil, southern America. 

2) night$>$day for weekday but not weekends
This pattern may indicate late work schedules, which result in late rush hours. 
Some areas, such as western China, eastern Peru and Western China, follow this pattern. 

3) nigh$>$day irregardless weekdays or weekends
As the radiation hinders the NO2 forming process, night $>$ day also occur in countries receiving high radiations during daytime. This theoretically happen to countries close to the equator. In this study, however, we observe this pattern in US, Canada except coastal areas, and Russia.  
The night>day NO2 may be caused by incomplete road networks and less populations. (observing the SHAP values for the four day and night models

\section{Discussion}
Result discussion. 
Incompleteness OSM is a well-recognised issue and cannot be hidden. 

%question. where do we publish it, a web-service for viewing will greatly help with the publication. 
%The four maps in 10 km resolution with 100 m zoom in windows for details. 
%2.	On a map service, e.g. mapbox, publish the 4 maps
%3.	In a data depository, publish the predictors and 4 result maps (possibly 100m resolution)

In \cite{LU2020105856}, it was found that using an ensemble tree based algorithm, such as XGBoost \citep{chen2016xgboost}, the global model achieved a similar cross-validation accuracy in a country compared to the corresponding national models developed in countries with relatively densely distributed ground station networks. In comparison, a global linear regression model falls far behind those national models. On the one hand, it is a promising result showing that with machine learning methods, a global model could potentially catch up with the performance of a national model with relatively sufficient ground stations. On the other hand, the manuscript does not discuss the effect of unequal distribution of the ground stations in this analysis. The ground stations from countries with a relatively dense ground station network also dominate the global dataset and as a result, contributing the most to the NO2 process captured in a global model. As such, it might be too imprudent to claim that e.g. the XGB is promising in global modelling, though it is obviously outperform a linear regression model, at least with the current data availability.

 \section{To be clarified}

 1. the area (extent) of the world.   
 2. computation time
 3. all data convert back to wgs84 (4626) before merging?
 - gdal\_merge requires the same CRS for datasets to be merged. 
- we could consider to merge to 6x6 degree and publish those, similar approach is done by others
- how to publish data? (zenodo etc); creating a viewer and host?
